1. It is one of the tas given by my Mentor in my previous Organization, 
    where he gave "APNA-Job portal" as reference and told me to first understand structure; list possible API's in Excel sheet and then start 
    whole work.
2. As usual, configured basic TypeScript as required.
3. As similar to AWS S3 bucket, Implemented FireBase Storage bucket and stored Images in it which gave Download URL which is stored in MongoDB database
4. Implemented :   
                 (i). User (Job-seeker) Login ; Authorisation with JWT token
                (ii). With OTP validation with Expiration; Did'nt implement Twillio OTP sending in this mini-project as I did in my previous.
                (iii). Implemented API for User to get Jobs based on Job Role, Salary, User's Pre-defined Suggestions
                (iv). API to store Applications in User's Point of view and Employer's Point of view
